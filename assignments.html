  <center><em>I decided to interview my 17 year old brother Jackson. Initially, I was going to interview my 14 year old brother.
  On the day of the interview he lovingly<br> and compassionate told me to screw off then hung up the phone. So I decided to
  interview Jackson on what it is like to be a high schooler in today’s day and age.</em></center><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Interviewer:<font size="3"> What is your name and age?</font> <br>
  <br>
  <b>Jackson:</b><font size="3"> You know my name and age, I’m your brother!</font><br>
  <br>
  Interviewer:<font size="3"> Jaaaackson, will you please just answer the question?! <br></font>
  <br>
  <b>Jackson:<font size="3"></b> <em>(incoherent mumbles)</em> Yes, my name is Jackson West and I am 17 years old.</font><br>
  <br>
  Interviewer:<font size="3"> What is it like for you to be in high school?</font><br>
  <br>
  <b>Jackson:</b><font size="3"> I feel like right now high school is in a transitional stage, more or less. It is determining what our <br>
  education in the future is going to look like. Our class rooms are constructed for different learning styles, and
  more <br> based around technology rather than shutting it out. We even have a video call system set up in some of our langue<br>
  classrooms, and other schools that don’t have the money to hold that class now can. We are kinda like ginny pigs testing<br>
  out the waters of this new era of education. I guess you could call use trailblazers.</font><br>
  <br>
  Interviewer:<font size="3"> <em>*small chuckles*</em> Thats actually a really interesting point, and even contrasts to my own high school experience.
  <br>Moving on to the next question, who is your favorite teacher at school and why, how has this person changed your life, etc.?</font><br>
  <br>
  <b>Jackson</b>:<font size="3"> Mrs. Gregg, she is my teacher and debate coach. She has helped me breaking out of my shell of being nervous.<br>
  As well, overall be a better speaker and communicate a lot more. To get out there and get involved in high school. She <br>
  encourages everyone to mingle. The debate team is a debate family. She has affected my life in the way,<br> that if I never
  took debate I would not be the same.</font><br>
  <br>
  Interviewer:<font size="3"> That is amazing, I hope she knows that! Did you tell her that?! Jack that is so sweet and cute, you should
  tell <br> her that….awe… Okay, so what are some goals you would like to complete this year or in the near by future?</font><br>
  <br>
  <b>Jackson:</b><font size="3"> Ahhh, long term… which is six months or more. I’ve been taught that, soooo. Basically I would like to get to
  nationals<br> and state champ for debate, I would like to speak sign langue to the extent I could communicate with someone,
  <br>as well as go to more games.</font><br>
  <br>
  Interviewer:<font size="3"> As you come to the end of your high school experience do you feel like you’ve had a “classic high school
  experience”,<br> with the homecoming, the football games, the prom king and queen, etc. Some high school musical shit, ya know?</font><br>
  <br>
  <b>Jackson:</b><font size="3"> So I feel like I have had a modify version of that, where I am able to experience a wider range of things.
  I have so many friends <br> in every grade, and always have. Rather than just being friends with people your own age and
  feeling scared to interact with anyone<br> older than you. I am in multiple clubs, I go to school dances, and football games.
  I feel like I’ve had a well rounded experience of both<br> the traditional and non traditional.</font><br>
  <br>
  Interviewer:<font size="3"> Fantastic, I really appreciate your thoughtful answers. Before we end this interview I would
  like to ask you one more question.<br> If you could expel one stereotype about being a teenager today, what would that be?</font><br>
  <br>
  <b>Jackson:</b><font size="3"> Uhhhhhhh, that all teenagers are entitled. I know a lot of people who work incredibly hard.
  They work two jobs, they are intelligent.<br> But because they are teenagers people don’t give them credit.
  People think they are entitled to think they are smart or hard working, whatever.<br> That “Oh they think they are
  successful now, but just you wait until they get into the real world.” People think that teenagers are smart, special,<br>
  etc just because their parents told them that, but I have found that not to be the case at all. And it all because of their age.<br>
   Also, we don’t all smoke dope.</font><br>
  <br>
  Interviewer:<font size="3"> Alrighty, then. Thank you Jackson for giving us some insight into your life. Love ya punk.</font><br>
  <br>
  <b>Jackson:</b><font size="3"> You’re welcome, and you owe me lunch or you can just venom me.</font><br>
