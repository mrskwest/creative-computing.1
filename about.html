  Here is a brief overview of myself, feel free to proceed or not. Whatever you feel
  like really.
  SO… <br>
  <br>
  I am originally from Utah, and before we move on I will answer your questions. Yes,
  I grew up Mormon.<br> No, I am not currently practicing. I only have one mom, and no, I
  have not seen the play.I am the oldest of three.<br> I have two brothers one is 17 and one
  is 14. Jackson is 17 and I adore him with all my heart. My other brother <br> is 14 and sort
  of a pain in everyone’s ass, but I still love him.I am a Communication Design major, so
  I am freaky obsessed<br> with typeface. I based which bank I chose off of who had the
  better font. Anyways, I recently picked up <br>roller skating and I am fully committed to
  becoming  the next Tony Harding. I mean, I am the most ungraceful<br> person I know so just
  imagine what that looks like on eight wheels.<br>
  <br>
  For now that will do.<br>
