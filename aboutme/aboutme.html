I am originally from Utah, and before we move on I will answer your questions.<br> Yes, I grew up Mormon.
No, I am not currently practicing. I only have one mom, and no, I have <br>not seen the play.

I am the oldest of three. I have two brothers one is 17 and one is 15.<br>
Jackson is 17 and I adore him with all my heart. My other brother is 15 and
sort of a pain in everyone’s<br> ass, but I still love him.

I am a Communication Design major, so I am freaky obsessed with typeface.
I based which bank I chose <br> off of who had the better font. Anyways,
I recently picked up roller skating and I am fully committed <br> to becoming the next Tony Harding.
I mean, I am the most ungraceful person <br>
I know. So, just imagine what that looks like on eight wheels.
For now that will do.
